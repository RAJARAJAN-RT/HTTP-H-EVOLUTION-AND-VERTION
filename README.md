# HTTP-EVOLUTION-AND-VERTION
Invention of the World Wide Web
In 1989, while he was working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal to build a hypertext system over the Internet. Initially calling it the Mesh, it was later renamed to World Wide Web during its implementation in 1990. Built over the existing TCP and IP protocols, it consisted of 4 building blocks:

A textual format to represent hypertext documents, the HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
A simple protocol to exchange these documents, the HypertText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
A client to display (and accidentally edit) these documents, the first Web browser called WorldWideWeb.
A server to give access to the document, an early version of httpd.
These four building blocks were completed by the end of 1990, and the first servers were already running outside of CERN by early 1991. On August 6th 1991, Tim Berners-Lee's post on the public alt.hypertext newsgroup is now considered as the official start of the World Wide Web as a public project.

The HTTP protocol used in those early phases was very simple, later dubbed HTTP/0.9, and sometimes as the one-line protocol.
